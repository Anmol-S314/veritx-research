# Verify — Outstanding Obligations

## Shared product and design contract

Create this surface for **Srota Studio**, a local desktop engineering application for NoC and hardware-system architecture. Use the attached approved screen as the visual reference. This contract and the specific brief below are the complete prompt; settled product decisions do not require another discovery interview.

### Product boundaries
- Preserve two journeys: workload-first architecture evaluation and existing-design improvement.
- Six contextual workspaces: Design; Workloads & Requirements; Analysis; Explore; Verify; Deliver. These are not mandatory wizard stages.
- Manual engineering remains fully usable offline without AI. AI is optional, closed by default, and never the database or primary navigation.
- Designs, workloads, requirements, studies, runs, snapshots, checks, and artifacts are explicit revisioned objects. Historical results remain applicable to their original immutable inputs.
- Support Srota, supported BookSim families, and custom graphs through configuration-specific capability checks. Modeling, simulation, verification, RTL generation, and target implementation are independent capabilities. Engine installation does not establish qualification.
- Distinguish connectivity, address mapping, access permission, routability, requested traffic, injection, delivery, and observed paths. Do not silently substitute one for another.
- Distinguish architectural intent, analytical estimates, simulation observations, generated RTL, verification evidence, and physical implementation. ASIC and FPGA qualification are separate.
- Complete accelerator generation is not an established capability. Declared compute/memory behavior does not generate compute datapaths. Mark supplied IP and model-only blocks explicitly.
- Planned interfaces may be designed, but document planned/unavailable status rather than claiming implementation. Unsupported descriptions may remain editable and exportable without becoming eligible for production RTL.
- Never invent simulator flags, generator versions, measurement artifacts, qualified configurations, proof results, overhead figures, process-specific power, or achieved timing. Do not include confidential internal specification contents in generated examples.
- Every repair is explicit and reviewable. Never silently modify architecture, relax requirements, remap endpoints, or replace the active design.

### Visual system
Retain the approved light-first industrial identity: Inter, JetBrains Mono for technical values, restrained blue accent, cool neutral surfaces, flat bordered panes, compact readable controls, and small radii. Inherit actual reference tokens rather than creating another palette.
Use essential text generally 12–14px. Support 1440×900, 1920×1080, and constrained 1280×800. Collapse/rescale pane structure rather than shrinking text. Use one contextual left pane, a dominant central workspace, a collapsible inspector, and one Jobs/Problems/Logs drawer when useful.
Do not reproduce known reference defects: duplicate Workbench Explorer rails, page-wide text-selection blocking, hidden scrollbars, decorative pulsing, unsupported thermal summaries, ambiguous global cycle counters, or duplicated status/navigation bars.
Use native-feeling selection, forms, tables, keyboard focus, copyable identifiers, visible scrolling, accessible icon labels, and non-color-only statuses. No marketing chrome, giant KPI walls, gradients as decoration, or chat-first layouts. Charts may use meaningful sequential/diverging scales.
Show empty, loading, unsupported, partial, failed, and revision-mismatch states where relevant. Explain each with a useful next action; distinguish zero from missing or not applicable. Do not turn every state into a modal.

### Evidence and numerical discipline
Always identify evaluated inputs, measurement definition, units, aggregation/window, source, and limitations where relevant. Execution success does not mean requirement compliance. Use Met, Violated, Not evaluated, and Inconclusive according to an explicit assessment policy.
A missing packet trace does not rule out measured percentiles when an appropriate histogram exists. Packet latency is not complete transaction latency. High utilization does not prove head-of-line blocking, starvation, deadlock, or a causal bottleneck.
Compare runs only with disclosed workload, measurement, backend, and assumption differences. Report scoped observations, not global optimality.
Keep sample arithmetic consistent. A 128-bit link transferring one flit/cycle at 1.4 GHz has 22.4 GB/s raw capacity per direction. Whole-network aggregates may exceed one-link capacity but need explicit scope. A 450,000-cycle window at that clock lasts about 321.4 microseconds.
Use shared illustrative identifiers where useful: project Falcon8_NoC_Gen2; evaluated design d7a4e9b; current draft changed afterward; workload ResNet50_Burst [w12]; requirements r5; completed run SIM-402; separate active job SIM-403. Keep these records consistent across surfaces. REQ-LAT-04's example threshold is 25 ns, not 20 ns; show 28.6 ns only with explicitly defined transaction-level measurement support. Otherwise show Not evaluated.
Keep “Illustrative sample data” visible. Do not invent evidence to preserve a successful-looking screen.

### Optional agents
Human and agent actions use the same validated operations, permissions, revision checks, and budgets. Approve one versioned exploration brief specifying workload, assumptions, requirements, allowed changes, search space, and execution limits. Included runs need no repetitive approvals; scope expansion requires new approval. Candidates remain isolated until human adoption.
ACP connects compatible agent runtimes; it is not a model provider or domain authorization system. Remote AI is optional and policy-controlled. Do not depict a connection as permission to execute arbitrary commands.

### Output discipline
Generate the specific requested surface and its meaningful variants inside this established system—not all workspaces at once. If producing HTML, distinguish local demonstration state from real integration. Do not fake queue acceptance, saved revisions, simulation completion, or repaired hardware with alerts/timers. Functional zoom must transform the view, not only its label. Use explicit demo states when integration is absent.

## Specific surface brief

Purpose: track unresolved engineering questions and required evidence, not just a generic issue list.

Use a filterable obligation table with identifier, precise question, affected objects/configuration, category, blocking consequence, owner if assigned, state, required evidence, and source. Categories may include interface contract, routing/progress argument, model assumption, generation support, verification coverage, and target qualification.

Keep architectural intent, draft specification text, implementation, and qualification evidence distinct. A detailed specification is not proof that RTL implements it. Do not reproduce confidential specification passages or invent resolved architecture decisions.

Selecting an obligation shows assumptions, why it matters, dependent checks/artifacts, related requirements, design revisions, and relevant findings. Separate verified defect from suspected issue or incomplete specification. Do not assert reachable deadlock or functional failure merely because a proof obligation is open.

States distinguish open, under investigation, evidence proposed, resolved with cited evidence, waived with authorized rationale/scope, and no longer applicable. Acknowledgement is not resolution. A waiver does not make hardware compliant with the original requirement.

Resolution review binds evidence to a claim and exact configuration. New edits may require re-assessment without erasing old resolution history. Sensitive ownership and annotations remain local/policy-controlled.

Show downstream consequences such as “blocks this output profile” or “limits this measurement claim” only where declared by eligibility policy. Do not make every open item a universal production blocker.

Deliver: obligation register, selected interface/coverage question, and evidence-backed resolution review. Include links to related Design objects, checks, requirements, and delivery readiness.
